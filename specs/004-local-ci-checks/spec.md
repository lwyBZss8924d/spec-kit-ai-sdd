# Feature Specification: Local CI Validation & Upstream Compatibility

**Feature Branch**: `004-local-ci-checks`  
**Created**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Define and enforce local CI checks for SDD compliance and upstream compatibility

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with clarification-needed notes: specific question
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any clarifications remain: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers
- üåê Written in English (all normative artifacts must be English-only)

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use clear "clarification-needed" notes for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story
As a maintainer, I want a fast local CI command that validates SDD structure, language policy, and upstream template compatibility so I can catch issues before attempting an upstream sync or opening a PR.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given a clean working tree, when I run `scripts/ci/run-local-ci.sh`, then it executes all configured checks and returns an appropriate exit code.
2. Given incomplete SDD artifacts in old/example folders, when lint runs, then excluded directories do not fail the check (configurable via SDD_LINT_EXCLUDE).
3. Given upstream templates have diverged, when template drift runs, then the check fails with a clear, actionable diff summary.
4. Given non-English characters in normative artifacts, when language check runs, then the check fails with file/line snippets for triage.

### Edge Cases
- Missing upstream remote: template drift should report a configuration error and exit non-zero.
- Large repos: CI should complete in under 60s on typical hardware (soft target).

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Provide a single entrypoint `scripts/ci/run-local-ci.sh` that orchestrates all CI checks and returns non-zero on any failure.
- **FR-002**: Implement SDD structure lint `scripts/ci/run-sdd-structure-lint.sh` verifying spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md for each feature (with configurable exclusions).
- **FR-003**: Implement language policy check `scripts/ci/check-language-policy.sh` flagging non-English letters in normative artifacts while ignoring emoji/symbols and fenced code blocks.
- **FR-004**: Implement template drift detection `scripts/ci/check-templates-drift.sh` comparing local templates against an upstream ref (default upstream/main) and failing on drift.
- **FR-005**: CI checks MUST print friendly summaries with clear remediation instructions and timing per check.
- **FR-006**: CI MUST integrate with the upstream sync workflow and be callable from `scripts/upstream/sync.sh` after merge/rebase.

### Non-functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: CI runtime should target < 60s on typical local hardware for this repository size.
- **NFR-002**: Exit codes must be reliable (0 pass, non-zero fail) to support automation.
- **NFR-003**: Scripts must be POSIX-friendly and run on macOS/Linux.

### Out of Scope
- Remote CI provider configuration (e.g., GitHub Actions workflows) is not part of this feature.
- Auto-fixing SDD structure or language violations.

### Key Entities
- **CiRun**: timestamp, checks[], result
- **CiCheck**: name, status, duration, output, remediation
