# Feature Specification: Upstream Sync SDD

**Feature Branch**: `003-upstream-sync-sdd`  
**Created**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Implementation Ready  
**Input**: User description: "Synchronize fork with upstream github/spec-kit repository while preserving fork-specific SDD enhancements"

## Overview

This specification defines a comprehensive, deterministic workflow for synchronizing the spec-kit-ai-sdd fork with its upstream source (github/spec-kit). The process ensures safe integration of upstream changes while preserving fork-specific enhancements including SDD workflows, AI agent configurations, and validation scripts.

## Objective

Establish a reproducible, traceable process for pulling upstream changes that:
- Minimizes risk of breaking fork-specific functionality
- Provides clear visibility into compatibility issues
- Enables systematic conflict resolution
- Maintains complete audit trail
- Supports both maintainers and AI engineers

## Scope

### In Scope
- Fetching and analyzing upstream changes
- Generating comprehensive diff and compatibility reports
- Implementing safe merge/rebase strategies
- Systematic conflict resolution with categorization
- Adaptation workflows for breaking changes
- Quality validation and testing
- Documentation and reporting

### Out of Scope
- Publishing to package repositories (PyPI, npm)
- Automated conflict resolution without review
- Bi-directional sync (pushing to upstream)
- GUI tools or web interfaces
- Scheduled/automated sync triggers
- Integration with external CI/CD services
