# Language Policy Implementation - Complete

## Feature: English-Only Normative Artifacts

### Status: ✅ COMPLETE

## Summary

Successfully implemented and deployed an English-only language policy for all normative artifacts (specifications, plans, tasks, documentation) across the spec-kit-ai-sdd repository.

## Implementation Details

### Pull Requests

1. **PR #4** - Original combined implementation (CLOSED)
   - Status: Closed due to workflow validation issues
   - Reason: GitHub Actions security prevents modified workflows from running in the PR that modifies them

2. **PR #5** - Core language policy implementation (MERGED)
   - Added Language Policy as Principle VI in constitution
   - Updated all SDD templates with language requirements
   - Added language directives to AI command templates
   - Updated agent context files (CLAUDE.md, WARP.md)
   - Created validation script `scripts/sdd/check_language.sh`
   - Status: ✅ Merged to main

3. **PR #6** - CI workflow integration (MERGED)
   - Added `language-policy` job to `.github/workflows/sdd-ci.yml`
   - Integrated language check into CI Summary
   - Non-blocking during bootstrap phase
   - Status: ✅ Merged to main

## Files Modified

### Core Policy Files
- `memory/constitution.md` - Added Principle VI: Language Policy
- `WARP.md` - Added language policy section
- `CLAUDE.md` - Extensive language policy guidance
- `dev-docs/sdd/CLAUDE.md` - SDD-specific language policy
- `dev-docs/cli/CLAUDE.md` - CLI-specific language policy

### Template Updates
- `templates/spec-template.md` - Language guideline and checklist
- `templates/plan-template.md` - Language policy section
- `templates/tasks-template.md` - Language validation
- `templates/agent-file-template.md` - Language policy section
- `templates/commands/specify.md` - Language directive
- `templates/commands/plan.md` - Language directive
- `templates/commands/tasks.md` - Language directive

### Validation & CI
- `scripts/sdd/check_language.sh` - Language validation script
- `.github/workflows/sdd-ci.yml` - CI job integration

## Validation Script

The `check_language.sh` script:
- Scans all normative artifact directories
- Detects non-ASCII characters (excluding data files and comments)
- Reports violations with file and line number
- Returns appropriate exit codes for CI integration

### Script Features
- Excludes binary files, images, and data formats
- Allows non-English in code comments (for developer communication)
- Provides clear error messages with locations
- Non-blocking warnings during bootstrap phase

## Testing

### Local Testing
```bash
./scripts/sdd/check_language.sh
# Output: ✓ All normative artifacts are in English
```

### CI Testing
- Language check runs on every push and PR
- Currently non-blocking (warnings only)
- Can be made blocking by updating summary check

## Policy Enforcement

### Scope
The policy applies to:
- Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)
- Specifications (`specs/**/*.md`)
- Implementation plans
- Task descriptions
- Technical documentation
- Issue descriptions
- Commit messages (recommended)

### Exceptions
Non-English content is allowed in:
- Code comments (for developer communication)
- Data files (JSON, CSV, etc.)
- Test data
- User-facing content (when localization is required)
- External documentation references

## AI Agent Integration

All AI agents (Claude, Gemini, Copilot, Warp) have been updated with:
1. Clear language policy statements
2. Automatic enforcement in artifact generation
3. Bilingual communication support (conversation vs. artifacts)
4. Validation reminders in checklists

### Agent Behavior
- Agents communicate in developer's preferred language
- All generated artifacts are in English
- Agents provide translation when needed
- Policy violations are flagged during review

## Benefits

1. **Global Accessibility**: All team members can understand specifications
2. **Consistency**: Single language reduces ambiguity
3. **AI Compatibility**: Better support across different AI models
4. **Tool Integration**: Improved compatibility with development tools
5. **Knowledge Sharing**: Easier collaboration across teams

## Future Enhancements

1. **Automated Translation**: Add tooling for translating legacy content
2. **Stricter Enforcement**: Make CI check blocking after bootstrap
3. **IDE Integration**: Add pre-commit hooks for local validation
4. **Metrics**: Track policy compliance over time
5. **Documentation**: Create migration guide for existing projects

## Migration Guide

For existing projects adopting this policy:

1. Run validation script to identify non-compliant files:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/sdd/check_language.sh
   ```

2. Review and translate identified content

3. Update AI agent configuration files

4. Enable CI job in workflows

5. Communicate policy to all team members

## Conclusion

The English-only language policy has been successfully implemented across all layers of the spec-kit-ai-sdd repository. The implementation is comprehensive, well-tested, and ready for production use. The phased approach (core implementation followed by CI integration) ensured smooth deployment without disrupting existing workflows.
