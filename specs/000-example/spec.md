# Specification: SDD Bootstrap System

**Feature ID**: 000-example
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Status**: Implementation
**Author**: Claude Code
**Date**: 2025-09-09

## Feature Overview

Bootstrap a complete Spec-Driven Development (SDD) system that enforces structured development workflows, enables multi-agent collaboration, and maintains full traceability from requirements to deployment.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Developer Onboarding
**As a** new developer joining the project
**I want** clear SDD documentation and examples
**So that** I can quickly understand and follow the development workflow

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Can find and read SDD constitution
- [ ] Can understand the 8-phase lifecycle
- [ ] Can see example specifications and task plans
- [ ] Can run validation scripts locally

### Story 2: AI Agent Integration
**As a** developer using AI assistants
**I want** properly configured agent context files
**So that** agents understand their roles and boundaries

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] CLAUDE.md files provide clear guidance
- [ ] AGENTS.md documents multi-agent coordination
- [ ] MCP servers properly documented
- [ ] Safety boundaries enforced

### Story 3: Automated Validation
**As a** team lead
**I want** automated SDD compliance checking
**So that** all changes follow our development standards

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] CI validates structure on every PR
- [ ] Unresolved clarifications block merge
- [ ] Task traceability verified
- [ ] Documentation linted

## Functional Requirements

### FR-001: Governance System
The system SHALL provide governance documentation that:
- Defines core SDD principles
- Establishes development gates
- Documents the lifecycle phases
- Provides amendment procedures

### FR-002: Agent Support
The system SHALL support multiple AI agents with:
- Context files per development area
- Defined roles and permissions
- MCP server integration guides
- Safety boundaries and escalation paths

### FR-003: Validation Tools
The system SHALL validate compliance through:
- Python structure validation script
- Bash semantic consistency checks
- Documentation linting
- Security scanning

### FR-004: CI/CD Integration
The system SHALL automate validation via:
- GitHub Actions workflows
- Multiple validation jobs
- AI code review capability
- Non-blocking advisory checks

### FR-005: Testing Infrastructure
The system SHALL provide testing through:
- pytest test suite
- SDD validation tests
- CLI functionality tests
- Coverage reporting

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-001: Performance
- CI pipeline completion < 5 minutes
- Validation scripts < 30 seconds
- Test suite < 1 minute

### NFR-002: Compatibility
- Python 3.11+ support
- Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows via WSL)
- GitHub Actions compatible
- Multiple AI agent support

### NFR-003: Security
- No hardcoded credentials
- Token management documented
- Secret detection in CI
- Least-privilege agent permissions

### NFR-004: Maintainability
- Clear documentation
- Modular script design
- Consistent code style
- Version-controlled configurations

## Technical Constraints

1. **Language**: Primary implementation in Python and Bash
2. **CI Platform**: GitHub Actions required
3. **Documentation**: Markdown with Google style guidelines
4. **Version Control**: Git with specific branch/commit conventions

## Acceptance Criteria

### Phase 1: Setup
- [x] All governance documents created
- [x] Directory structure established
- [x] Agent contexts defined

### Phase 2: Implementation
- [x] Validation scripts functional
- [x] CI workflows configured
- [x] Tests written and passing

### Phase 3: Documentation
- [x] Configuration files added
- [x] Example artifacts created
- [ ] README updated with quickstart

### Phase 4: Validation
- [ ] Run full validation suite
- [ ] Verify CI passes
- [ ] No security issues found
- [ ] Documentation complete

## Out of Scope

- Production deployment automation
- Database migrations
- User authentication system
- Frontend UI components

## Dependencies

- Python 3.11+
- GitHub repository
- GitHub Actions runners
- Optional: markdownlint, ripgrep

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|------------|
| Complex CI setup | High | Medium | Start simple, iterate |
| Agent incompatibility | Medium | Low | Support multiple agents |
| Adoption resistance | High | Medium | Provide clear examples |
| Secret exposure | High | Low | Multiple validation layers |

## Success Metrics

1. **Adoption**: 100% of new features use SDD workflow
2. **Quality**: 0 unresolved clarifications in production
3. **Traceability**: 100% commits reference tasks
4. **Automation**: 100% PRs pass SDD validation

## Review Checklist

- [x] All user stories have acceptance criteria
- [x] Functional requirements are testable
- [x] Non-functional requirements are measurable
- [x] No unresolved clarifications
- [x] Dependencies identified
- [x] Risks documented with mitigations
