# Issue: SDD Bootstrap Implementation

**Issue ID**: ISSUE-000
**Type**: Feature
**Priority**: High
**Status**: In Progress

## Description

Bootstrap a complete Spec-Driven Development (SDD) system for the Spec Kit repository to enable structured, traceable development workflows with multi-agent support.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **SDD Governance**
   - Constitution defining principles and gates
   - Lifecycle documentation with enforcement
   - Amendment process for evolution

2. **Agent Support**
   - Context files for AI agents (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md)
   - MCP server integration
   - Safety boundaries and permissions

3. **Validation & CI/CD**
   - Automated structure validation
   - Documentation linting
   - Security scanning
   - AI code review integration

4. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Python test suite
   - SDD compliance tests
   - Coverage reporting

5. **Documentation**
   - Git worktree guide
   - Development configurations
   - Example artifacts

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Compatibility**: Python 3.11+, cross-platform
- **Performance**: CI runs < 5 minutes
- **Security**: No hardcoded secrets, token management
- **Maintainability**: Clear documentation, modular scripts

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All governance documents created and complete
- [ ] Agent context files present in all required locations
- [ ] CI/CD workflows passing on main branch
- [ ] Test suite executable with pytest
- [ ] Validation scripts functional
- [ ] No unresolved placeholders in documentation
- [ ] Example artifacts demonstrate workflow

## Dependencies
